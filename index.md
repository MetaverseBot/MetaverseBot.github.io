<p>The Robot Design, Innovation Project and Robot Game are 
what teams DO.</p>
<p>The Core Values are how they do it.</p>
<p>Here are some quotes.</p>
<p>“Learn and compete like 
crazy, but treat one another 
with respect and kindness”</p>
<p>Dr. Woodie Flowers, FIRST Distinguished Adviso</p>
<p>“ Teams can and should 
help and cooperate with 
each other even as they 
compete”</p>
<p>Dr. Woodie Flowers, FIRST Distinguished Adviso</p>
<p>Core Values is not just 
something you do. 
It is a way, a METHOD
of doing things that 
builds character and 
guides us throughout 
the whole experience!</p>
